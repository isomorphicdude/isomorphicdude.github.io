## Returning to recurrent state i.o.   

A recurrent state is defined to be a state $i$ with $Pr(\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}\{X_n\}|X_0=i)=1$. Now we wish to show $Pr(\text{returning i.o.})=1$. 

Define $A_m$ to be the event that the chain returns to $i$ at the $m^{\text{th}}$ time step and $B_m$ to be the event that the chain never returns to $i$ after the $m^{\text{th}}$ time step.  

$$Pr(\cup_{m=1}^{\infty} A_m \cap B_m)=Pr(\text{returning finitely often})$$  

So we wish to show 
$$P\left( \left(\cup_{m=0}^\infty A_m \cap B_m \right)^C \right) =1$$  

which is the probability of returning $i.o.$. Now we see by axioms and the condition of a recurrent state.  
$$Pr(\cup_{m=1}^{\infty} A_m \cap B_m) \leq Pr(\cup_{m=1}^{\infty} B_m)=0$$  

Therefore we have the desired result.
