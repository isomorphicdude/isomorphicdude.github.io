# **Orthogonal Polynomials**  

## **Motivation**  

Wish to approximate a function more easily using polynomials. Functions like $\frac{1}{25x^2+1}$ cannot be approximated by Taylor inside the unit disk, so we need alternatives.  

## **Definition**  

Orthogonal polynomials are determined by **graded basis** and **inner product (w/ weight)**.  

### **Graded Basis**  

$$
\{p_0(x), p_1(x), \cdots, \}
$$  

- Each $p_k(x)$ has degree exactly $k$  

- Unique coefficients $k_n^{(j)}$'s for $p_n(x)=\sum_{j=0}^n k_n^{(j)}x^j$  

### **Inner Product determined by $w(x)$**   

Defined for positive weight $w(x)>0$ on interval $(a,b)$  



## **Existence and Uniqueness**  

## **Common Orthogonal Polynomials**  

## **Jacobi Matrices**
