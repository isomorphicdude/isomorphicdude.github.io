I am currently an MSc student in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford. Prior to this, I graduated from Imperial College London with a BSc in Mathematics.    

This is my blog where I discuss things I am interested in (mostly probability, statistics, and machine learning). There are also some posts that I have written for my courses (in fact, most of the posts are written for my courses).   

I also have another academic website which is under construction. However, here is a short collection of my academic work. 

## Publications and Writings  

- **UROP 2023 Report**: On Pre-conditioned Langevin Dynamics and its Applications to Score-based Generative Models. [Link](https://isomorphicdude.github.io/assets/Draft.pdf)
