Hi! I am @isomorphicdude.

I am currently a PhD student at Imperial College London in the Department of Mathematics. Prior to this, I graduated with an MSc in Statistical Science from the University of Oxford and a BSc in Mathematics from Imperial College London.

This is my blog where I discuss things I am interested in (mostly probability, statistics, and machine learning). There are also some posts that I have written for my courses.
