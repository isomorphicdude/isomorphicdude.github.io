Hi! I am @isomorphicdude (semi-anonymous for now, as I have a proper academic website under construction).

<!-- <sub>It's easy to guess and use ChatGPT!</sub> -->

I am currently a PhD student at Imperial College London (again!) in the Department of Mathematics. Prior to this, I graduated with an MSc in Statistical Science from the University of Oxford and a BSc in Mathematics from Imperial College London.

This is my blog where I discuss things I am interested in (mostly probability, statistics, and machine learning). There are also some posts that I have written for my courses.   

<!-- I also have another academic website which is under construction. However, here is a short collection of my academic work.  -->

<!-- ## Publications and Writings
